# GOG Galaxy integration for Crackwatch
This plugin allows you to list as owned all the AAA titles marked as cracked on [crackwatch.com](https://crackwatch.com/) in your GOG Galaxy 2.0 launcher.  
  
You can use this integration to keep an eye on the game cracking scene, keep track of games you do not currently own and you previously played or want to play in the future.
  
>*Crackwatch currently lists a total of **17796** cracked games of which **1189** are AAA.*  
>*Due to there being so many listed cracked games, the GOG client would continuously crash when trying to import over 17k games, therefore I decided to focus this project on AAA titles only*
